# Overview
1. This repository (mostly) contains code written to be run on a **Raspberry Pi 4b Rev 1.4**.
2. The raspberry pi is running `Ubuntu 22.04.05 LTS`. Kernel version at time of writing: `5.15.0-1074-raspi`
3. We are using `ROS2 Humble`. This can be installed on the operating system with [this script](../../Tools/Setup-Scripts/install-ROS2-Humble) for your convenience. Please note that this script exclusively works on Ubuntu, and not on any debian-based OS (including RaspberryPi OS). 
4. The radio being used is the RFD 900x-US.
