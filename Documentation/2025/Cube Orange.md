# Cube Orange setup

Configuration notes for using the Cube Orange with EMBR.

## DroneKit (Python 3.10+) compatibility

Our setup scripts apply this patch automatically. If you installed manually and encounter a DroneKit import error on Python 3.10+, apply the following changes to `dronekit/__init__.py` in your Python site-packages directory (e.g., `~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/dronekit/__init__.py`).

Changes:
1. Replace `import collections` with `import collections.abc as collections`
2. Add `from collections.abc import MutableMapping`
3. Change class definition:
	- From: `class Parameters(collections.MutableMapping, HasObservers)`
	- To:   `class Parameters(MutableMapping, HasObservers)`

Tip: To locate the file, you can run `python3 -c "import dronekit, inspect, os; print(os.path.dirname(inspect.getfile(dronekit)))"`.

## Radio receiver and RC input

Connect your receiver to the Cubeâ€™s RC input:

1. Receiver PPM/CH1 header (bottom-up): GND, 5V, Signal
2. Cube RCIN header (bottom-up): Signal, 5V, GND
3. Provide battery power to the receiver and Cube (USB power is often insufficient for RC + ESCs)

Transmitter configuration (example):
1. Hold Ok until Menu 
2. Click ok and navigate to RX Setup -> Output mode
3. Choose output PPM and Serial i-BUS

Calibrate radio in your flight stack (Mission Planner) so channels map as expected.

## ESC and motor outputs

Connect ESC signal leads to Cube Main Out pins:

1. Cube Main Out pins are, bottom-up: Signal, 5V, GND
2. In the flight stack, map Servo Output N to the desired function
	- Servo Output index correlates to Main Out N
	- Set the Function to match your control output from Radio Calibration

Safety
- Remove props during setup and calibration
- Ensure proper power distribution for ESCs and receiver
